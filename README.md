# Air-Traffic-Control-System-Simulator
Air Traffic Control System Simulation is intended to be a simulation software that simulates air traffic control systems for domestic flights in Thailand. The software is developed in Python with a core library named “pygame” which is designed for writing video games. The output of the simulation is presented in a 2-Dimensional graphic, top view.

The simulator provided some tools and commands to manipulate with. For example, a button for play or pause the simulation, a command to generate a new flight, etc. The user will take on the role of air traffic controller and control the behavior of the plane of each flight. The main goal of a user is to avoid a collision between the planes. In order to avoid a collision between the planes, a user must consider many factors such as speed, direction, and altitude of each plane. There is also detection for future potential collisions between planes, which will notify the user both textually and graphically.
